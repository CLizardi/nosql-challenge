# Introduction:

In this project, i used MongoDB as the primary NoSQL database and worked on a dataset that contains information about products, sales, and customers.

# Tools Used:

MongoDB (NoSQL database)
Node.js (JavaScript runtime)
Express.js (Node.js web application framework)
Mongoose (MongoDB object modeling tool)
Postman (API testing)

# What I Learned:

In this NoSQL challenge, I learned basic concepts of NoSQL databases and how they differ from SQL databases. I also learned how to query NoSQL databases using MongoDB Query Language (MQL) and how to use Mongoose, an ODM (Object Document Mapping) library for MongoDB, to define and interact with MongoDB collections. Additionally, I gained experience in building a RESTful API using Node.js and Express.js.

# How These Tools Can be Beneficial:

These tools can be beneficial in many ways. NoSQL databases are especially useful when dealing with large amounts of unstructured data, such as social media posts or IoT data. MongoDB provides scalability and flexibility to the database schema as it allows adding new fields dynamically without affecting the existing data. Node.js and Express.js provide a powerful and scalable way to build web applications and APIs. Finally, Mongoose provides an easy-to-use interface for interacting with MongoDB collections and simplifies the process of defining and enforcing schemas on collections.
